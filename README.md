# HypeBot
A hypebeast is someone who has a passion for high-end street wear. High end street wear typically goes on sale on a "drop" where on a certain date and time a limited set of clothing is stocked within a stores shop. The supply is so limited many items sell out within minutes and some within seconds. Products can increase by 100s of dollars in value immediately after they are purchased. Many people have taken to buying the clothing with the aim to resell it for profit with demand being so high. Hypebot aims to give anyone vying for an exclusive piece of clothing wether for wear or resale, a good shot at purchasing it.
